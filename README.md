## Using

~~~
wp solid backups merge-wp-config [--config-file=<path>] [--porcelain]
~~~

It only accepts JSON via STDIN following the same format generated by the
"wp config list --format=json" command.

The command exits with the following codes
 - "0" indicates all provided values were saved.
 - "1" indicates invalid input was provided.
 - "2" indicates no values were saved.
 - "3" indicates some values were saved, and some failed.

**OPTIONS**

	[--config-file=<path>]
		Specify the file path to the config file to be read. Defaults to the root of the
		WordPress installation and the filename "wp-config.php".

	[--porcelain]
		Only output keys that failed to save.

**EXAMPLES**
    # Contents of to-import.json
    [
     {
       "name": "table_prefix",
       "value": "wp_",
       "type": "variable"
     },
     {
       "name": "DB_NAME",
       "value": "solid-backups",
       "type": "constant"
     }
    ]
    $ cat to-import.json | wp solid backups merge-wp-config
